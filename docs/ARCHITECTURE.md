# System Architecture

## Overview

The Insider Threat Detection System is built using a modular architecture that combines machine learning models with real-time monitoring capabilities. The system is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and secure.

## Components

### 1. Data Collection Layer
- Employee behavior data collection
- System log monitoring
- Network activity tracking
- File access patterns

### 2. Processing Layer
- Data preprocessing
- Feature extraction
- Anomaly detection
- Risk scoring

### 3. Machine Learning Models
- Isolation Forest for anomaly detection
- Random Forest for risk assessment
- PCA for dimensionality reduction

### 4. Dashboard Interface
- Real-time monitoring
- Interactive visualizations
- Alert system
- User management

## Data Flow

1. Raw data collection from various sources
2. Data preprocessing and feature extraction
3. Model prediction and risk assessment
4. Results visualization and alert generation

## Security Considerations

- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Role-based access control
- Audit logging
- Secure API endpoints

## Performance Optimization

- Caching mechanisms
- Asynchronous processing
- Batch processing for large datasets
- Optimized database queries

## Future Enhancements
